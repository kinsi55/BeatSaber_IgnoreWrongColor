# BeatSaber_IgnoreWrongColor

Simple plugin that ignores interaction of sabers with blocks of not-their-color, thus allowing for more creative patterns without needing to worry about badcutting. Commissionned by Nolanimations, who also created a map himself for this :D https://beatsaver.com/maps/29b9c

### Players

You can toggle on this plugin for any map with its toggle in the Mods tab is on. Its only working on Solo / Party, not MP.

If you are playing a map which is specifically made for this plugin, you dont need to manually turn on the plugin - It will be auto-enabled and score submission stays enabled.

### Mappers

Add the `IgnoreWrongColor` ***Suggestion*** (NOT requirement) to your map. If the plugin is installed, this will force its functionality on and still allow score submission
